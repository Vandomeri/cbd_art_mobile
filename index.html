                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>While many users of CBD have a myriad of reasons why they choose to use it, the general consensus
                        is that CBD provides a better sense of wellness and overall wellbeing. The results of this can
                        manifest in the body or possibly the mind, so we always advise prospective customers to try out
                        CBD for themselves at a responsible level and to determine the effects for themselves.</p>
                </div>

            <details>
                <summary>How Much CBD Oil Do You Need?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>When it comes to dosing things can often get a bit confusing. As we mentioned above, regardless
                        of the type of CBD product you have, you’ll want to start off slow, to find out what works for
                        you. <br><br>

                        For example, because CBD is fat-soluble, a heavier set person may see improved results as the
                        oil becomes absorbed into the body’s excess fat cells more readily. <br><br>

                        So, when finding your ideal CBD intake schedule, start small and work your way up. You can
                        measure your CBD intake with your tincture dropper. Apply a bit under your tongue and swish it
                        around your mouth for maximum effect for about a minute. If you fail to feel the intended
                        effects of your CBD, try a larger amount in a few hours or the next day.</p>

                <summary>Can You Take CBD Oil Tinctures For Pain?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>We can’t say. Literally and legally. As of the 2018 Farm Bill, industrial hemp and all of its
                        derivatives were made legal, meaning that everything from CBD gummies to full spectrum CBD oil
                        were now available to the public. However, for years, due to the previous illegality of CBD,
                        hemp, and cannabis, research on the plant and its chemical compounds was limited. Although much
                        research has been done since then with real clinical trials, animal studies, and peer-reviewed
                        papers, there’s still a great deal of knowledge that we’ve yet to discover about the effects of
                        CBD. <br><br>

                        As it stands, the overarching information we have on the effects of CBD is from consumers like
                        yourself—as a result, it’s largely subjective. People take CBD for a variety of reasons and
                        thankfully, have found relief in both their minds and their bodies through the continual use of
                        CBD products like CBD oil. <br><br>

                        Along with the reported benefits of CBD oil, another consideration for positive responses is the
                        “entourage effect.” The entourage effect is found in both broad spectrum CBD oil and also full
                        spectrum CBD oil. It effectively references the notion that when the various cannabinoids found
                        in broad spectrum and full spectrum CBD are allowed to work together synergistically, they
                        produce a more pronounced series of benefits. <br><br>

                        Obviously, it’s worth mentioning that none of this is possible without the endocannabinoid
                        system (ECS). This system bridges the gap between the cannabinoids you get from CBD (and the
                        ones your body naturally produces). <br><br>

                        As the ECS produces physiological responses to CBD, it’s possible that it is a leading cause for
                        the feeling of bodily relief derived from CBD.</p>

                <summary>Can You Use CBD Oil To Stop Smoking?</summary>
                <div class="faq__content">
                    <p>For many people, quitting smoking is one of the hardest—and most worthwhile—habits they’ll ever
                        give up. Cigarette smoking has been routinely linked to cancer and other medical conditions, and
                        causes a bevy of comorbidities in the body that increase the chances of death as you get older.
                        <br> <br>
                        However, for those who want to give up the habit, what often holds them back is less about
                        nicotine, but the action of smoking itself. It’s why people who smoke will opt to chew gum or
                        eat candy. It’s something else that replaces the physical action of smoking a cigarette. In the
                        case of CBD, it’s been reported that many have replaced the physical action of smoking a
                        cigarette with eating a gummy, hitting a CBD-filled vape, or taking a few drops from the
                        tincture. <br><br>
                        By supplanting these kinds of bad habits with wellness-boosting ones like intaking CBD, many
                        users have had an easier time transitioning away from cigarette smoking.
